# Final Project Ideas

## Controller for the Zortrax Robotic Arm
Because the Zortrax robotic arm is already being built as another project, my potential project could be to design a controller to interface with the arm. Some ideas are:

* Voice control such as in [this project](http://www.instructables.com/id/Voice-Controlled-Robot-Arm/)
* Using a joy stick or game controller
* Using image processing to perform movements based on the user's facial expressions
* Using a gesture armband, such as in the Myo armband
* Using an EEG sensor (but this may not be reliable)
* Using eye tracking such as in [this project](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-EyeWriter-20/)

## 3D Printed Piano
Using a 3D printer, this potential project could print the keys of the keyboard and have a capacitive sensor for the Arduino to detect which key is being pressed. Each printed piano key would be mapped to a capacitive sensor so that the Arduino can detect which key is being pressed. Once the key is pressed, a piezo will make the desired sound based on the key being pressed.

This idea is based off of [this project](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/490/paper-instruments-fadcd4)

This proposed project would feature more piano keys and an option to change the pitch of the keyboard, e.g. to change the scale from C5 to C6.
