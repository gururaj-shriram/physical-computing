#MindLight 3D Model

To learn 3D Modeling using Onshape, I recreated the case from MindLight as a 3D Model. The model looks like this:

The case itself is hollow to reflect the real case that was used, which was a cardboard box. The larger cut out on the front face is where the LEDs of MindLight are placed, and the smaller cut out on the right is for the USB opening of the Arduino. The model closely follows the true case; however, there may be slight measurement errors due to human error. The model can also be viewed as an Onshape document [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/83f4221aefc5af569f4602f5/w/3657b603fdf197dbcdf6e909/e/8756f4a04f40712a55ad4a7a)!
