# Midterm Project Ideas

## Paper Piano
Using Conductive Paint, it can be a paper piano that plays notes based on where the user touches. Each piano key would be mapped to a capacitive sensor so that the Arduino can detect which key is being pressed. From there, a p5js program can read in the key input from the Arduino and mimic a piano key being pressed on the screen.

This idea is based off of [this project](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/490/paper-instruments-fadcd4)

This proposed project would feature more piano keys and an option to change the pitch of the keyboard, e.g. to change the scale from C5 to C6.

## Robotic Grabber
Using an EEG sensor, and a robotic arm/grabber, the project would map a sensor reading to an action of the grabber. The grabber would be able to move in the four cardinal directions, be able to extend and retract, and be able to open or close. Once trained, it is clamped onto a surface and can function to reach and grab objects.
