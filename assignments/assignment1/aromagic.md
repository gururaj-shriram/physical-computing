# AroMagic
## Any Aroma. Almost by magic.

AroMagic is an aroma machine that can create any aroma that the user chooses. Just by adding water and placing essential oils in the cartridges, AroMagic can diffuse a pleasant fragrance throughout the room. The machine can be used as follows:

1. Fill the water tank up to the designated line and ensure that the desired essential oil cartridges are not empty (AroMagic can automatically detect which cartridge corresponds to which essential oil).
2. Concoct the desired aroma by doing one of the following:
  * Changing the intensity dial for each essential oil
  * Entering percentages for each essential oil by touching the desired essential oil on the touch menu and entering percentages with the key pad
  * Choosing a preset recommendation from the given aromas. This is recommended for first-time AroMagic users!
3. Save the aroma.
4. Turn the time dial for the desired amount of time (in intervals of 30 minutes) that AroMagic should operate (for a maximum of 8 hours).
5. Press the Start button. The machine will combine the combination of essential oils with water and output the fragrance with steam.
6. Enjoy the magical aroma!

## Notes
* It is recommended to pour out the water and refresh the water tank with fresh water after every use.
* If the amount of an essential oil falls below 10%, it is recommended to replace the cartridge.
